Hello, world. My research agenda is organized around three areas: `macroeconomics`, `Bayesian statistics`, and `evolutionary dynamics`. One line of my current research develops time and frequency-domain approaches to dynamic equilibrium models of expectations formation. Another line develops Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for estimating large-scale structural models. These tools are applied to study monetary and fiscal policy, asset prices, and a variety of related topics in macroeconomics and finance. Recently, I like to train Bayesian neural nets regularized by economic theory. My previous research studies the evolution of cooperative and altruistic human behavior.

Currently, I teach macroeconomics and econometrics at Saint Louis University. Meanwhile, I work on competitive programming projects of data science. I am also a thematic investor for space economy and have rich experience in derivative trading.
