```c
#include <stdio.h>

main() {
    printf("hello, world\n");
}

Grounded in first principles, my research develops algorithmic solutions for complex social systems at the intersection of `artificial intelligence`, `economics`, and `statistics`. One line of my research develops time-domain and frequency-domain approaches to dynamic equilibrium models with strategic agents. Another line develops Bayesian methods for estimating large-scale structural models. These tools are applied to study economic policy, asset prices, and social networks. Recently, I like to train neural nets regularized by economic theory. My previous research studies the evolution of cooperative and altruistic human behavior.

As an educator, I teach economics, statistics, and computer science with comprehensive open-source curricula on GitHub. I also co-founded [Business School 101](https://www.youtube.com/@BusinessSchool101), a YouTube channel with over 100k subscribers democratizing business education. Beyond the classroom, I am a thematic investor for space economy and have rich experience in derivative trading.
